To open and run the project in Android Studio:

Prerequisites: Have Android Studio installed on your system. Have an emulator/android device installed/attached with a compatible version (Android version 4.2.2 or greater).

Step1: on the terminal, clone the repo:

git clone git@github.com:Dev4X/Phase1.git
Step2: Start up Android Studio ( https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html )

File > New > Import Project... Select the Phase1 folder you just cloned in the terminal.

Now the project should load, and you should see sections 'app' and 'Gradle Scripts' in the Project tab on the left.
